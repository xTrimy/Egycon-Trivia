# svelte-counter

A simple css-agnostic count-up component for Svelte 3.

## Installation 🔧

First you need a [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) 3 project. Its starter template lives at https://github.com/sveltejs/template.

Then install the component by running the following command in your project's directory:

```sh
npm install svelte-counter
```

## How to use 🚀

1. First import the component on your svelte page's script section.

```js
import Counter from 'svelte-counter';
```

2. Declare your counter variables as one object like so (again in the script section):

```js
export let counters = {
    'coffees'	: 88,
    'hours' : 1600,
    'lines' : 6132,
    'clients'	: 22
}
```
_You can use anything *valid* you like for variable & key names, it doesn't matter!_

3. Call the component where you want it to be placed e.g.:

```html
<Counter values={counters} duration="5000" random="false" minspeed="200" let:counterResult>
    <div>{counterResult.coffees} cups of coffee drunk</div>
    <div>{counterResult.hours} hours worked</div>
    <div>{counterResult.lines} lines of code written</div>
    <div>{counterResult.clients} happy customers</div>
</Counter>
```

In the slot space between `<Counter></Counter>` you can write your template however you like. Use the same keys you declared above for the counterResult object in your template.

_I recommend not to change the "counterResult" object name. If you need to you can do it like so:_
```
let:yourvariable="counterResult"
```

### Configuration Options
All the following options are optional:
| Name | Default | Description |
| ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| duration | 5000 | Effect duration in milliseconds |
| random | false | Randomize the counting (might go even backwards) |
| minspeed | 20 | The fastest it will tick in milliseconds, larger means slower |

## Missing ❌
* Decimals support - Could do it but most people only want integer counters. Will update upon request.
* Tests - It's pretty straight forward but feel free to contribute.
* Demo Page - Will do.
